# C++ Full Course (more or less)

## Why?

I created this website because a friend needs it, because the college he goes to makes stupid decisions or just wants to
see you fail at what you love doing. In the hopes to help him and maybe a few others, I make this whenever I have some
free time and want to, which means pretty much all days since I have no social life. I mean, I know C++...

-----------------

## Are you doing it alone?

Yes, I am. Told you I have no social life.

-----------------

## Who can learn it?

Pretty much anyone interested in it (I hope) but keep in mind that **it's not easy**. C++ is hard. C++ is a very
low-level language designed for performance. We make OS's and game *engines* with it, not pretty UI's. If you want a
somewhat low-level language but not that complex, I suggest taking a look into Java. But if you really have the balls to
try it, go ahead! I made it for that. Also, I know a lot of C++ but don't expect me to do a tutorial on OpenGL or
Windows DLL's. I might, since I'm absolutely out of my mind, but the chances are slim.

And don't expect a very formal language and a precise structure because that bores me to death. I do bad dad jokes
whenever I think of one and might be unapologetically sarcastic. Nothing you should worry about anyway, you'll be going
so crazy over C++ that it will actually keep you sane. But remember, as much as I like joking, this. Is. C++.

-----------------

## I don't understand [whatever].

Neither do I. Just kidding, if you know me, you either have my phone number or can get it. If you don't, the internet's
your best friend.

-----------------

## There's a mistake [somewhere].

Just submit a pull request and I'll review it and hopefully accept it too. If it's just a matter of writing, I'm very
certainly gonna accept it and merge it into the main branch. If it's code... I hope you did as much research as I did,
and keep in mind that even though I try to be as precise as possible, I can't avoid simplifying somethings.

-----------------

## I have a suggestion/request!

I uh... I'll have to find a way to make requests and suggestions "available" for everyone but for now, unless you have
my number or whatnot, you'll have to wait. Sorry.
